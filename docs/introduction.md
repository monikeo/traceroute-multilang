## Introduction to Traceroute Project

Welcome to the **Traceroute Project**, a comprehensive resource for understanding and implementing the traceroute network diagnostic tool across multiple programming languages. This project not only explores the technical principles and practical implementations of traceroute but also serves as an educational platform for networking enthusiasts and software developers.

### What is Traceroute

**Traceroute** is a tool used to map the path data packets take to reach a specific destination in a network. It identifies each intermediate router (hop) along the route and measures the round-trip time (RTT) for each hop. This helps diagnose network issues, analyze performance, and understand network topology.

### Key Features of Traceroute
1. **Hop-by-Hop Analysis**: Displays every intermediate router in the path.
2. **Latency Measurement**: Measures the RTT for packets to reach each hop.
3. **Protocol Versatility**: Supports ICMP, UDP, and TCP-based methods.

### Why This Project?

The **Traceroute Project** aims to provide:
- A deep dive into traceroute principles, protocols, and methods.
- Implementations of traceroute in multiple programming languages (e.g., Rust, Python)
- Tutorials and guides for learninig and building traceroute from scratch.
- A repository of code that is modern, maintainable, and feature-rich.

### Target Audience

This project is designed for:
- **Students** learning computer networks and systems programming.
- **Developers** looking to understand and buuild network diagnostic tools.
- **Networking Professionals** who need customizable traceroute tools.
- **Educators** searching for resources to teach networking concepts.


### What You'll Learn

By exploring this project, you will:
- Understand how traceroute works, including its use of the TTL field and ICMP response.
- Learn about different protocols used in traceroute: ICMP, UDP, and TCP.
- Gain experience with low-level programming concepts like raw sockets.
- Build and customize traceroute implementations in Rust, Python ...
- Design and structure software projects with maintainable, modular code.
